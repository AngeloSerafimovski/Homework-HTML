      The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based
      in <strong>Los Angeles</strong>. The Lakers compete in the
      <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association">National Basketball Association (NBA)</a></em></strong> as a
      member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Lakers play
      their home games at <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena">Crypto.com</a></strong> Arena, an arena they share with the Los
      Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and
      the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL).[8] The Lakers
      are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA with 17
      championships, the second most in the league behind the Boston Celtics.[9]
      The franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball
      League (NBL).[10] After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to
      Minneapolis, Minnesota,[11][10] and renamed the team as the Minneapolis
      Lakers.[12] The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the
      rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA
      championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in
      1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships.[13] After
      struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles
      before the 1960–61 season.

In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.[224] They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals.[225] Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.
