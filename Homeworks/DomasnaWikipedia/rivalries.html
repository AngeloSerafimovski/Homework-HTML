    <h1>Lakers-Celtics rivalry</h1>
    <p>
      The Celtics–Lakers rivalry is a National Basketball Association (NBA)
      rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers. The Celtics
      and the Lakers are the two most storied franchises in the NBA, and the
      rivalry has often been called the greatest in the NBA. The Boston Celtics
      and the Los Angeles Lakers have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals,
      starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would both go on to
      dominate the league in the 1960s and 1980s, facing each other six times in
      the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, and two times in 2008 and 2010. The
      Lakers and Celtics are tied for the highest number of championships in the
      NBA at 17 apiece, (12 as the L.A. Lakers and 5 as the Minneapolis Lakers).
      Together, they account for 34 of the 74 championships (or 45%) in NBA
      history. As of 2018, the Celtics and Lakers have a .590 and .596 all-time
      winning records respectively. As of the end of the 2017–18 season, Boston
      is the only team with a winning overall record against the Lakers.
